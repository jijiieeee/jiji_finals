  <pre class="css">      Convincing someone to change their mind is really the process of convincing them to
    <br>change their tribe. If they abandon their beliefs, they run the risk of losing social ties. You
    <br>can’t expect someone to change their mind if you take away their community too. You have
    <br>to give them somewhere to go. Nobody wants their <a href="https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">worldview </a> torn apart if loneliness is the
    <br>outcome.

    <br>The way to change people’s minds is to become  <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Friends" target="_blank">friends </a> with them, to integrate them into
    <br>your tribe, to bring them into your circle. Now, they can change their beliefs without the
    <br>risk of being abandoned socially.

    <br>The British <a href="https://www.invaluable.com/blog/famous-philosophers/?srsltid=AfmBOoq0ihR6JhLIDFqncI3s2h-pIc0TgBWtcTc0hz2yBgvPJCV1m8he" target="_blank">philosopher </a> Alain de Botton suggests that we simply share meals with those
    <br>who disagree with us:

    <br>“Sitting down at a table with a group of strangers has the incomparable and odd benefit of
    <br> making it a little more difficult to hate them with  <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/impunity" target="_blank">impunity </a>. Prejudice and ethnic strife feed
    <br> off abstraction. However, the proximity required by a meal – something about handing 
    <br>dishes around, unfurling napkins at the same moment, even asking a stranger to pass the 
    <br>salt – disrupts our ability to cling to the belief that the outsiders who wear unusual clothes
    <br> and speak in distinctive accents deserve to be sent home or assaulted. For all the large-scale 
    <br>political <a href="https://www.vedantu.com/chemistry/solution-concentration-properties" target="_blank">solutions</a> which have been proposed to salve ethnic conflict, there are few more 
    <br>effective ways to promote tolerance between suspicious neighbours than to force them to 
    <br>eat supper <a href="https://genius.com/Rick-astley-together-forever-lyrics" target="_blank">together </a>.”

    <br>Perhaps it is not difference, but distance that breeds tribalism and hostility. As proximity 
    <br>increases, so does <a href="https://www.forbes.com/quotes/theme/understanding/" target="_blank">understanding </a>. I am reminded of Abraham Lincoln’s quote, “I don’t like 
    <br>that man. I must get to know him better.”

    <br>Facts don’t change our minds. Friendship does.
